Kindle Highlight Organizer
---

## What is this?
I'm working on this application because currently I feel there's no good way to consolidate all the highlights from the 
books I read and make connections between books. This application takes JSON dumps using
Bookcision (URL) and stores them in this Django Application.

I will then use these highlights to categorize my books and create quote collections from books
Eventually I wanna to do some learning on these quotes to make meaningful connecitons and recommendations for more books.

This is a WIP.
